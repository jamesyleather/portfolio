			<h2>About Jamesy</h2>
			<p>James Leather pursues a simple design, and the production is a one-man process that starts from start to finish manually.</p>
			<p>The leather used is a vegetable leather, which is made up of eco-friendly processes. To prevent the skin from decaying, the tanin, a vegetable dye, is used to process it. It's produced from a tenor belonging to the Verapelle Society that doesn't kill cows for leather and thinks about the environment. The vegetable leather has the characteristic of aging by capturing the feeling of the day you use it. I think the more you use it, the more stylish it is with you, the more attractive it is.</p>
			<p>Due to the nature of the vegetable leather, there may be spots, tendons, wrinkles, scratches, etc. and the wool (embo) may not be constant.</p>
